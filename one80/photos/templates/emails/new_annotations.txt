Hello there,

This is just a friendly email to let you know there are some new annotations awaiting your approval:

{% for annot in annotations %}
 - {{ annot.name }}, {{ annot.position }} in {{ annot.hearing.title }}
   http://180.sunlightfoundation.com/admin/photos/annotation/{{ annot.pk }}/

{% endfor %}

As a reminder, you can always see the unapproved queue at http://180.sunlightfoundation.com/admin/photos/annotation/?is_public__exact=0

Thanks and have a great day!
